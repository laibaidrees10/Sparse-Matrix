# 🧮 Sparse Matrix ADT (C++)

A generic **Sparse Matrix Abstract Data Type** implemented in C++ using templates and `std::vector`. This project supports operations like setting and retrieving values, diagonal sum (recursively), transposition, and multiplication of sparse matrices, optimized for space by storing only non-zero elements.
